Depression is a serious medical condition that can have a negative impact on our emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. It is a leading cause of disability worldwide and has a significant economic impact. Depression analysis is the process of gathering and interpreting information about depression to identify risk factors, develop new treatments, and improve the quality of care for those with depression.

We in this paper collected Bangla depressive data from social media and trained eight multi-class classification algorithms to analyze the reasons for depression. We may found that counseling based on Islamic principles may be an effective means of addressing the causes of depression among Bangla speakers.

This study is the first to investigate the causes of depression in Bangla social media data and to offer Islamic-based counseling. It makes a significant contribution to the field of Bangla NLP by developing a new method for analyzing Bangla social media data for depression.
